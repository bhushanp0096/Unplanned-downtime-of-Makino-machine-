Problem Statement
To Reduce The Unplanned Downtime Of The Machine.

AMS (accelerator mass spectrometry) and Makino machines are two of the company's machines, and the project's objective is to decrease machine downtime, or non-production time, by improving OEE (overall equipment efficiency).

No Pre-Set Standards
How to reduce the unplanned Downtime of makino machines?

We have to find out the causes that making the machine to do unplanned down time Downtime – machine is not working because of breakdown, man, insufficient material,etc…many causes are there...!

So we have to reduce the downtime by increasing the OEE(overall equipment efficiency), how much efficient the machine is..!!

We have to evaluate a lot of features that is causing the down time for machine and taking a decision to reduce the down time based on consider factors....!!!
